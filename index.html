Cokie Young 

About
My name is Cokie, and I'm from Tennessee. 
I became interested in coding severals years back
when I was working on a research project. I hope to 
elevate my real-world problem solving skills with
Code the Dream.  

Experience

I worked on a project that studied the effect
of audiovisual stimulation on sleep. I was responsible
for coding the stimuli tasks and automating
the analysis.
