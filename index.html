            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Cokie, and I'm from Tennessee. 
            I became interested in coding severals years back
            when I was working on a research project. I hope to 
            elevate my real-world problem solving skills with
            Code the Dream.</p>

            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>I worked on a project that studied the effect
            of audiovisual stimulation on sleep. I was responsible
            for coding the stimuli tasks and automating
            the analysis.</p>
